# Blog Card Section Populator

This project fetches data from the New York Times RSS feed to populate a "Blog Card Section" on a web page with the titles and descriptions of blog posts.

## Description

This simple web application uses JavaScript to fetch the RSS feed from the New York Times website and dynamically updates the content of three cards on the page. Each card displays the title and description of a blog post fetched from the RSS feed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
-   Visual Studio Code or any text editor

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/blog-card-section-populator.git`
2.  Open `index.html` in a web browser or use a live server extension in Visual Studio Code to run the project.

## Usage
